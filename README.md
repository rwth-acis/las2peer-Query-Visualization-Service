# MobSOS Query Visualization

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwth-acis/mobsos-query-visualization.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwth-acis/mobsos-query-visualization) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rwth-acis/mobsos-query-visualization/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rwth-acis/mobsos-query-visualization) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/rwth-acis/mobsos](https://badges.gitter.im/rwth-acis/mobsos.svg)](https://gitter.im/rwth-acis/mobsos?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

MobSOS Query Visualization is a Web service for the interactive exploration and
visualization of relational data sets. The exploration basically consists
in authoring query visualizations that can be persisted, exported to written reports
or published on Web sites. Authoring a query visualization consists in three simple steps:

1. selecting a _data set_,
2. formulating a _query statement_ (usually in SQL) and
3. selecting a _visualization type_ (e.g. pie or bar chart).

Optionally, query statements and visualizations can be parameterized and further
described by meta data such as title or display dimensions.

## Use

- You can try the service at https://las2peer.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/qv-service/.
- The wiki of this project features a [tutorial](https://github.com/rwth-acis/LAS2peer-Query-Visualization-Service/wiki/Tutorial) with step-by-step instructions.
- A short description of the service's browser interface is available as separate [help page](http://las2peer.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/qv-service/help.html).

## Build

Before you build the project make sure you have set up a [database](db.sql).

```
mysql -u YOUR_USER -p -e 'CREATE DATABASE QVS;'
mysql -u YOUR_USER -p QVS < db.sql
mysql -u YOUR_USER -p -e "SET GLOBAL time_zone = '+00:00';"
```

Enter the credentials in the [property file](etc/i5.las2peer.services.mobsos.queryVisualization.QueryVisualizationService.properties).
The following values are important:

| Property     | Description             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| stDbKey      | Default database key    |
| stDbHost     | Host for the connection |
| stDbPort     | Port of the SQL Server  |
| stDbDatabase | Name of the database    |
| stDbUser     | Login name              |
| stDbPassword | Password                |

Execute the following command on your shell:

```shell
./gradlew clean build --info
```
_Sometimes the tests would fail on the first run. try the above command again if that happened to you_

## Deploy

The start_network.bat script uses the L2PNodeLauncher class to start the service. It does also register
the content of the "startup" directory and it starts the Web-Connector at port 8080.

For running the frontend server read [#frontend](#frontend)

## How to run using Docker

First build the image:

```bash
docker build . -t mobsos-query-visualization
```

Then you can run the image like this:

```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=myuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypasswd -p 8080:8080 -p 9011:9011 mobsos-query-visualization
```

Replace _myuser_ and _mypasswd_ with the username and password of a MySQL user with access to a database named _QVS_.
By default the database host is _mysql_ and the port is _3306_.
The REST-API will be available via _http://localhost:8080/QVS_ and the las2peer node is available via port 9011.

In order to customize your setup you can set further environment variables.

### Node Launcher Variables

Set [las2peer node launcher options](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project/wiki/L2pNodeLauncher-Commands#at-start-up) with these variables.
The las2peer port is fixed at _9011_.

| Variable           | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Other Variables

| Variable | Default | Description                                                                |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEBUG    | unset   | Set to any value to get verbose output in the container entrypoint script. |

### Frontend

In your frontend, make sure to adjust the `data-redirect` attribute in the sign-in button of the `frontend/demo.html` file. 

```html
    data-redirect="http://localhost:5500/demo.html"
```

Also you need to change the `data-clientid`.

```html
    data-clientid="localtestclient"
```

You also need to adjust the REST API endpoint. In `frontend/js/queryviz.js`,adjust the `LASHOST` variable to reflect the url on which your endpoint is reachable.

```js
var LASHOST='http://127.0.0.1:8080/';
```

Then you can build and run the frontend server:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

### Volumes

The following places should be persisted in volumes in productive scenarios:

| Path              | Description                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| /src/node-storage | Pastry P2P storage.                    |
| /src/etc/startup  | Service agent key pair and passphrase. |
| /src/log          | Log files.                             |

_Do not forget to persist you database data_

## Background

The original use case behind MobSOS QV was the exploration of MobSOS datasets
for metrics explaining the success (or failure) of artifacts (i.e. services or tools)
provided by a _community information system (CIS)_. Any MobSOS data set comprises
automatically collected, cleaned and metadata-enriched _usage data_ as well as
end-user-contributed _survey data_. The exploration of possible CIS success metrics
is much more convenient and intuitive with the help of interactive query visualizations.
Additional persistence of such query visualizations enables analysts to build up
their own _CIS success metric catalogues_, to create dashboards showing query visualizations
on real-time data and ultimately to compile MobSOS-style hierarchical _CIS success models_.
CIS success metrics thereby serve as proxy indicators of certain _CIS success factors_.
These factors in turn are assigned to one of six predefined and scientifically validated
_CIS success dimensions_. The result is a CIS success model to be validated and refined
over time to reflect a community's changing understanding of CIS success for given CIS
artifacts. However, MobSOS QV quickly turned out to be a rather generic tool for query
visualizations on arbitrary relational data sets. It has been used for creating dashboards
on the evolution of different scientific or open-source developer communities.
